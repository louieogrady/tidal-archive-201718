# TidalCycles code archive 2017-18 

This repo documents ideas written for TidalCycles during 2017/2018.

Please be aware that these were written prior to Tidal 1.0, the release of which brought about some changes in syntax, most notably in regards to this repo, ```scale```, ```bps```, ```discretise``` and ```sine1``` are no longer supported/have been replaced.

Some of the code here has been recorded and can be [heard here](https://soundcloud.com/muesliboys)

Please also be aware that the code in this repo relies heavily on sample packs and field recordings that are included in the samples folder that comes with SuperDirt (Dirt-Samples).

LoopMidi was used to connect Tidal with external synths/reaktor. 

The SuperCollider startup file included in this repo (startup-addedorbits.scd) mainly sets up the use of 'orbits' (which most files here use) to create separate audio outputs. You can read about this [here if necessary](https://tidalcycles.org/index.php/Separate_audio_outputs)
